##ðŸŽ¯ Recommender System

ManiFest includes a festival recommender system that suggests events to users based on their past activity.
It uses **Collaborative Filtering** (Matrix Factorization) to learn hidden patterns from tickets and positive reviews, and then predicts which upcoming festivals a user is most likely to enjoy.
If thereâ€™s not enough data to train the model, a fallback heuristic approach recommends festivals from similar categories or organizers the user already liked.
